      Founded in 2023, Byte & Brew was born from our passion for great coffee and technology. What started as a small corner cafe has grown into a beloved community space where students, professionals, and coffee lovers gather. 
We carefully source our beans from sustainable farms and roast them locally to erisure maximum freshness. Our pastry chef crestes delicious homemade treats daily using traditional recipes with a modem twist. 
More than just a cafe, we're a space that fosters creativity and connection whether you're coding your next project, studying for exams, or just enjoying a quiet moment with a perfect cup
